# Task 1 - Dataset Understanding

This task analyzes two datasets — the Titanic dataset and the Students Performance dataset — to understand data types, missing values, and machine learning readiness.

Steps performed:
- Loaded both datasets
- Checked data types and missing values
- Identified target and features for each dataset
- Analyzed class imbalance

Conclusion:
Both datasets are suitable for machine learning after basic preprocessing such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing class imbalance.
